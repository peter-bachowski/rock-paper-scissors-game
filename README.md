# rock-paper-scissors-game

This HTML/CSS/JS code is the first project during The Odin Project course where I will be implementing javascript to a greater extent using logical operators as well as loops.

This practice is meant to show my ability to use logic to solve a problem, in this case to creat the logic for a rock paper scissors game, where the player plays against the computer that randomly selects either rock, paper or scissors. As this project progresses I will add more logic code and hopefully implement some nice css as well.

This code will be a work in progress and I will try ton continually add code when I can.
